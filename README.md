## Setup/Installation Requirements

1. Clone this repository to your desktop `git clone https://github.com/CGrahamS/headlamp.git`
2. Open with Android studio.
3. For best results in emulation use the 4" WVGA (Nexus S) API 23 profile.

## Known Bugs

* The list view in the ServerDetailsActivity formats first two items of the supplied array with the first argument twice. Likely because the variable names are not unique. This results in an incorrect offset, supplying values to the wrong labels.
